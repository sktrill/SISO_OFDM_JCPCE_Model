# SISO OFDM JCPCE Model
JCPCE Error Correction for SISO Wireless System

<p><b>Problem</b></p>
Create SISO OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing) wireless system model using BLAST (Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time) algorithm and JCPCE error correction methods

<p><b>Solution</b></p>
OFDM is fast becoming the leading 4G application for efficient and reliable communication in multipath environments. OFDM remains an attractive option due to its robustness under frequency selective fading and its ability to mitigate both inter-symbol interference (ICI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) while delivering high data rates. However certain limitations to OFDM, such as frequency synchronization issues brought on my carrier frequency offset (CFO) and phase noise (PHN) effects can have a detrimental effect on system performance. This however can be mitigated through the use of a Joint Carrier Frequency Offset/Phase Noise/Channel Impulse Response Estimator (JCPCE) that finds optimal estimates for the CFO, PHN and CIR. This model  aims to examine the impact of CFO and PHN on a Single-Input Single-Output OFDM system and investigates the viability of the JCPCE algorithm in mitigating these limitations to the OFDM system.
